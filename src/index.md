I'm Kathryn de la Rosa, a Filipina-American dramaturg and astrologer from Kentucky. I've worked with Audible Theater producing their Emerging Playwright Commissions and directly with playwrights like Alex Lin, Kaela Mei-Shing Garvin, and Kimberly Belflower. My BA is in Theatre & Drama and Journalism from Indiana University, and during the pandemic I did graduate work in religious studies at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities.

These days I write CLI apps in Python and write a newsletter called HACKSTROLOGY about technology and astrology that comes out each new and full moon. In general, I am interested in the collision (contradiction) of premodern traditions and modern sciences; in my Substack era [I read Bertolt Brecht's birth chart](https://kathryndelarosa.substack.com/fuck-it-heres-brechts-birth-chart).

## work with me

I'm available for script consultations on a sliding scale and longer-term dramaturgical collaborations, for which you can contact me at *krdlrosa at gmail dot com*.

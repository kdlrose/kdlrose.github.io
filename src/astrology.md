I've studied western astrology since 2017 and started consultations in 2021. My practice is grounded in translated Hellenistic and medieval Persian texts and largely an actualized historical interest. As far as belief goes, I'm Ralph Fiennes in *Conclave*.

I use whole sign houses, the five major aspects, and emphasize the seven visible planets while making conservative use of Uranus through Pluto.

## readings

- **60-minute reading, $90 USD** – This is a good fit if you're new to astrology or don't quite know what you're looking for. We'll take a tour of your natal chart starting from the ground with your ascendant and its ruler, then look up at the sky at the lights and other planets.
- **90-minute reading, $140 USD** – Your foundational natal reading with something on the side, such as:
    * current or past transits
    * your birthday (solar revolution + annual profection)
    * your Saturn return

Readings take place over [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si). I record audio externally with [Audacity](https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/recording-desktop-audio) and share it with you for your future reference via [Send](https://send.vis.ee/).

To book a reading, email me at *krdlrosa at gmail dot com*.

## newsletter

I write a newsletter each new and full moon called HACKSTROLOGY. Each issue has, at minimum, a lunarscope and a preview of the next two weeks. The bulk of the letter is often an essay on a topic like planetary joys, techniques I'm learning like elections, or a post about astrological FOSS. You can [read the archive](https://buttondown.com/hackstrology) before you subscribe.

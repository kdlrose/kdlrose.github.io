I've studied western astrology since 2017 and did consultations early in the pandemic way before I should have. My practice is grounded in translated Hellenistic and medieval Persian texts and largely an actualized historical interest. As far as belief goes, I'm Ralph Fiennes in *Conclave*.

I use whole sign houses, the seven traditional planets, and the five major aspects. I make conservative use of the outer planets, Uranus through Pluto, primarily for timing techniques. I offer the following:

- Natal chart reading, $75
- Natal chart with transits, $100
- Transits reading, $50

You can read in more detail about these readings and book one of your own over on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hackstrology/commissions).

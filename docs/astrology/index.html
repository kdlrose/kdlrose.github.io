<p>I've studied western astrology since 2017 and did consultations early in the pandemic way before I should have. My practice is grounded in translated Hellenistic and medieval Persian texts and largely an actualized historical interest. As far as belief goes, I'm Ralph Fiennes in <em>Conclave</em>.</p>
<p>I use whole sign houses, the seven traditional planets, and the five major aspects. I make conservative use of the outer planets, Uranus through Pluto, primarily for timing techniques. I offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natal chart reading, $100 (90 minutes)</strong> – An introduction that builds your chart from the ground up starting with your rising sign and its ruler, then looks up at the sky to the lights and other planets on a tour of the patterns at play in your horoscope.</li>
<li><strong>Natal chart with transits, $140 (120 minutes)</strong> – If you're a new client, you can combine your horoscope with a transits check-in, which includes short-term planetary movements and longer-lasting themes found in annual timing and Saturn returns.</li>
<li><strong>Transits reading, $66 (60 minutes)</strong> – For returning clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Readings take place over Zoom as either voice-only or video calls, but either way, I'll share my screen because this is primarily a type of pedagogy to me, and I want you to walk away with a better understanding of both yourself and astrology as a tradition.</p>
<p>To book a reading, email me at <em>krdlrosa at gmail dot com</em>.</p>

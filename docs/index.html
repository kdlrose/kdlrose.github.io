<p>I'm Kathryn de la Rosa, a Filipina-American dramaturg, software developer, and astrologer from Kentucky. I've worked with Audible Theater producing their Emerging Playwright Commissions and directly with playwrights like Alex Lin, Kaela Mei-Shing Garvin, and Kimberly Belflower. My BA is in Theatre &amp; Drama and Journalism from Indiana University, and during the pandemic I did graduate work in religious studies at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>These days I write CLI apps in Python and write a newsletter called HACKSTROLOGY about technology and astrology that comes out each new and full moon. In general, I am interested in the collision (contradiction) of premodern traditions and modern sciences; in my Substack era <a href="https://kathryndelarosa.substack.com/fuck-it-heres-brechts-birth-chart">I read Bertolt Brecht's birth chart</a>.</p>
<h2>work with me</h2>
<p>I'm available for script consultations on a sliding scale and longer-term dramaturgical collaborations, for which you can contact me at <em>krdlrosa at gmail dot com</em>.</p>
